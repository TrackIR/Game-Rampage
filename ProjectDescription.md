<!-- PROJECT STATEMENT -->
# Project Statement

This would be a small game with a minimalist style that functions like a 3D version of the game Rampage

The game should utilize TrackIR to capture head movements to provide input control for character movement.  

The goal of the game is partially open-ended but should include a focus on destroying buildings and the environment to generate a form of score.  The interpretation and details of this are left to the developers to decide.

The design of the monster and the environment is also left up to the developers.

An AI generated reference picture for what it COULD look like (do not anchor yourself to this it is just an example):
<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="RampagePic" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf906020-2342-417b-a477-f65c8ee31c3d" />

There should be a way to track score and an overarching goal and direction of gameplay that the player is encouraged to hit.

The goal of this is project is to leverage TrackIR to create a game that shows off head tracking in a fun and modern way that can be used to demonstrate interactive functionality at trade shows.

<!-- PROJECT SCOPE -->
# Project Scope

## Scope and Deliverables

1. Create a game that functions like a 3D version of Rampage, but using head movements tracked by TrackIR to control the character and play the game.
2. 3D “monster” (up to developer) characer that can be controlled using TrackIR and can interact with (destroy) the environment
3. Simple background environment to keep interest and flesh out the game world.
4. 3D buildings/structures that can be moved into/interacted with to destroy.
5. Score is tracked at the top of the screen.
6. IMPORTANT: TrackIR head tracking support that controls where you are looking or where you are looking AND where you are shooting depending on a property.
7. Settings window allowing you to configure things such as difficulty, environment, controls, camera functionality, etc.

## Stretch Goals

9. Leader board, so that people can compete for the high score at trade shows.
10. Game fog for extra difficulty.
11. Fun extras like death explosion.
12. Levels with different types of buildings/objects/hazards. 
   - Example: Different types of hazards such as enemies or environmental hazards to pressure your time/health.
   - Example: Different environmental slowdowns such as water and crags.

Out of Scope (Don’t do)
* Get stuck down a rabbit hole. There's probably a long list of other features that you could have for this game focus on the core features first.

# Success Criteria

At minimum, a game that looks and feels like the classic game Rampage, but designed to showcase TrackIR head tracking functionality and utilize it as the game play mechanic. 

This will be used for internal demos and tradeshow, so the game be short (2-5 minutes) sort of like playing old arcade games where they are trying to get you to spend as many quarters as possible by ramping up the difficulty quickly.

# Learning Goals 

Since this is aimed at being a student project it’s important to have some learning goals associated with the project. Those are roughly summarized below. 
* Learn how to interface with camera hardware through an SDK.
* Learn how to establish requirements and stakeholders for a project to validate progress.
* Camera control mapping and game play interactions.
* Learn basic 3D model creation and/or manipulation.
* Make a game utilizing hit boxes, scoring, and user interactions.
